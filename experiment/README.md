# Compiler behavior

This directory corresponds to the experimental evaluation of the behavior of the modified compiler.

To check that the code generated by this version of Jasmin is the same as the code generated by the original Jasmin, run:

    nix-shell --run './non-regression.sh'

To compare the compilation time of both compilers, run:

    nix-shell --run './compilation-time.sh'
